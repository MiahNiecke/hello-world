A: Making sure you fully understand the work is more important than rushing through cards.

Q: Why?

A: At the end of the day the goal is to be a good coder the best you can be. And if don’t understand the code your or others people code you won’t be able to succeed. We need to understand the what we are learning in order to apply it correctly. It doesn’t help to have a lot of knowledge on a certain topic but don’t know how to apply it in your work. Not understand work sabotage your opurtunity to get a job and to keep it once you have. Understanding is the key to success.
